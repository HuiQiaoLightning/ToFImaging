***Transient image reconstruction code***

see our paper: F. Heide, M. Hullin, J. Gregson, W. Heidrich.: 
Low-budget Transient Imaging using Photonic Mixer Devices.", SIGGRAPH 2013.

This folder contains a launcher script ('reconstruct_launch.m') that reconstructs 
the measurements in the data folder ('../data') with a single i-step. This gives 
already a fairly good solution and is reasonably fast to compute on a single machine.

The folder 'gaussian_exponential_model' contains a similar launcher file for 
i-step and u-step optimization, which is very costly and only efficiently to run
in parallel (we used multiple machines for that).

For any questions send me an email. The individual reconstruction results can be
found in the supplemental material of this project (which can be downloaded on the
webpage).
